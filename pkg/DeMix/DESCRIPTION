Description: Implementation of a statistical method for deconvolving
  expression data of mixed cancer tissues. It provides an estimation of both
  tumor proportion and tumor-specific expression (when neither is known
  a priori), and an estimation of individualized expression profiles for both
  tumor and stromal tissues.
Depends: R (>= 3.2), parallel
Imports: stats, DSS
Suggests: DeMixSampleData
